       "3  the   at storytelling the traditional sort many years after the event i can still see in my  eye an elderly lady my friends mother retelling the battle of  she makes the characters come alive her passion is that of an eye witness one to the events on the  heath a mile or so from where she lives   of course it happened many years before she was born but you wouldnt guess from the way she tells it the same story is told in bars the length and  of scotland as i discussed it with a friend one night in  a local cut in to give his version the discussion continued to closing time   stories passed down like this become part of our being who doesnt remember the stories our parents told us when we were children they become our invisible world and as we grow older they maybe still serve as inspiration or as an emotional  fact and fiction blend with  role models warning stories  magic and mystery   my name is  like my grandfather and his grandfather before him our protagonist introduces himself to us and also introduces the story that stretches back through generations it produces stories within stories stories that evoke the  wonder of scotland its rugged mountains  in  the stuff of legend yet  is  in reality this is what gives it its special charm it has a rough beauty and authenticity  with some of the finest  singing you will ever hear     visits his grandfather in hospital shortly before his death he burns with frustration part of him  to be in the twenty first century to hang out in  but he is raised on the western  among a  speaking community   yet there is a deeper conflict within him he  to know the truth the truth behind his  ancient stories where does fiction end and he wants to know the truth behind the death of his parents   he is pulled to make a last  journey to the  of one of  most  mountains can the truth be told or is it all in stories   in this story about stories we  bloody battles  lovers the  of old and the sometimes more   of accepted truth in doing so we each connect with  as he lives the story of his own life    the   is probably the most honest  and genuinely beautiful film of scotland ever made like  i got slightly annoyed with the  of hanging stories on more stories but also like  i  this once i saw the  picture  forget the box office  of braveheart and its like you might even  the  famous  of the wicker man to see a film that is true to scotland this one is probably unique if you maybe  on it deeply enough you might even re  the power of storytelling and the age old question of whether there are some truths that cannot be told but only experienced   \n",

       "0  this film was just brilliant casting location scenery story direction everyones really suited the part they played and you could just imagine being there robert  is an amazing actor and now the same being director  father came from the same scottish island as myself so i loved the fact there was a real connection with this film the witty remarks throughout the film were great it was just brilliant so much that i bought the film as soon as it was released for  and would recommend it to everyone to watch and the fly fishing was amazing really cried at the end it was so sad and you know what they say if you cry at a film it must have been good and this definitely was also  to the two little boys that played the  of norman and paul they were just brilliant children are often left out of the  list i think because the stars that play them all grown up are such a big profile for the whole film but these children are amazing and should be praised for what they have done dont you think the whole story was so lovely because it was true and was someones life after all that was shared with us all   \n",
